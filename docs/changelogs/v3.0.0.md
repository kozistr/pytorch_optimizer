## Change Log

The major version is updated! (`v2.12.0` -> `v3.0.0`) (#164)

Many optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and objective functions are in `pytorch-optimizer`.
Currently, `pytorch-optimizer` supports **67 optimizers (+ `bitsandbytes`)**, **11 lr schedulers**, and **13 loss functions**, and reached about 4 ~ 50K downloads / month (peak is 75K downloads / month)!

The reason for updating the major version from `v2` to `v3` is that I think it's a good time to ship the recent implementations (the last update was about 7 months ago) and plan to pivot to new concepts like training utilities while maintaining the original features (e.g. optimizers). 
Also, rich test cases, benchmarks, and examples are on the list!

Finally, thanks for using the `pytorch-optimizer`, and feel free to make any requests :)
